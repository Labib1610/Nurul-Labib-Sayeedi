Great! Here's a mix of basic problems and challenges related to lists and loops in Python:

1. *Sum of List:*
   - Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.

2. *Even Numbers:*
   - Create a program to print only the even numbers from a given list.

3. *List Reversal:*
   - Write a function to reverse a list.

4. *List Square:*
   - Create a new list with the squares of each element from an existing list.

5. *List Concatenation:*
   - Write a program to concatenate two lists.

6. *List Filtering:*
   - Implement a function to filter out elements from a list that are not divisible by a given number.

7. *Loop through a Dictionary:*
   - Iterate through the key-value pairs of a dictionary using a loop.

8. *Nested Lists:*
   - Write a program to flatten a nested list.

9. *List Comprehension:*
   - Rewrite one of the previous problems using list comprehension.

10. *Prime Numbers:*
    - Create a program to identify prime numbers in a given range using loops.

11. *Palindrome Check:*
    - Write a function to check if a given list is a palindrome.

12. *Unique Elements:*
    - Remove duplicates from a list and print the unique elements.

13. *Matrix Transposition:*
    - Implement a program to transpose a matrix.

14. *List Sorting:*
    - Sort a list of strings in alphabetical order.

15. *Loop Control:*
    - Use a loop with a break statement to find the first occurrence of a specific element in a list.

16. *List Intersection:*
    - Write a program to find the common elements between two lists.

17. *Matrix Multiplication:*
    - Implement matrix multiplication using nested loops.

18. *List Zip:*
    - Use the zip function to combine two lists into a list of tuples.

19. *Fibonacci Sequence:*
    - Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number using a loop.

20. *List Slicing:*
    - Experiment with list slicing to extract specific portions of a list.
